                <h2>What is StockFlow?</h2>
                <p>
                    StockFlow is a machine learning project that detects patterns in the stock market trading behaviour of a person.
                    <br/>
                    This website collects user data which can be used to train a neural network.
                    The trained network can then be used to do automatic trading on the stock exchange.
                    <br/>
                    For convenience, the user's trading decisions can be exported in JSON file format and used to actually trade the stocks with a broker (advanced computer skills required).
                </p>
                <br/>
                <a id="trade"><h2>Does StockFlow actually buy and sell stocks?</h2></a>
                <p>
                    No. StockFlow is like a demo portfolio. Users simulate buying and selling. No actual money is spent.
                    <br/>
                    However, if you like to use StockFlow to find interesting stocks to actually buy,
                    you can export your trade decisions along with the ISIN/WKN and the current price from <a href="http://stockflow.net/manage">your account page</a>.
                    An automatic tool that downloads the decisions 
                    and sends them to a broker is available on github at <a href="https://github.com/chrwoizi/stockflow/tree/master/StockFlow.Trader">StockFlow.Trader</a>. 
                    Programming skills are recommended. This reference implementation works with a specific german online broker only.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2>Is StockFlow free?</h2>
                <p>
                    Recording your trading decisions on stockflow.net is free. 
                    <br/>
                    You can export all your data on <a href="http://stockflow.net/manage">your account page</a>.
                    <br/>
                    The machine learning component of StockFlow is currently available as source only and therefore only suitable for people with advanced computer skills.
                    In the future, this website may integrate it at the user's cost.
                    See <a href="#train"><i>How can I train the neural network?</i></a> for more info.
                    <br/>
                    StockFlow is an open source project.
                    You can download the source code from <a href="http//www.github.com/chrwoizi/stockflow">github</a>.
                    If you are a nodejs programmer, you can run it on your own machine completely independent from this website.
                    You'd have to implement your own stock price provider, through. See <a href="#where"><i>Where can I use stockflow</i></a> for more info.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2>How can I record my trading decisions?</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="http://stockflow.net/signup">Sign up</a> for your free personal account.
                    <br/>
                    Go to the <a href="http://stockflow.net/app/#!/instruments">Instruments</a> page and click the 'Add all instruments' button.
                    The page should now show more than 10000 stocks.
                    <br/>
                    Click the <a href="http://stockflow.net/app/#!/snapshot/new/random">New Snapshot</a> menu item.
                    A snapshot of the current price history for a random stock is shown.
                    The top chart shows the daily closing prices of the past five years.
                    The bottom chart shows the past year magnified (which is also included in the top chart).
                    <br/>
                    Decide whether to buy the stock at the current price or wait another week to look at it again.
                    Click the according button.
                    <br/>
                    The next random snapshot will be shown. Repeat.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2>How can I see which stock I am looking at?</h2>
                <p>
                    The short answer: You better don't.
                    <br/>
                    The long answer: The machine learning workflow feeds your decisions to a neural network, together with the according stock price history.
                    The network learns to match the price history to your decision.
                    If you base your decision on more than just the price history, the neural network can't learn properly.
                    <br/>
                    Therefore, the 'New Snapshot' page hides the stock name deliberately.
                    You simply aren't supposed to associate the shown stock to any external information (such as news and analyst ratings).
                    If you really, absolutely must see the stock name, click on the 'HISTORY' button to show your previous decisions along with the stock's name.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <a id="where"><h2>Where can I use stockflow</h2></a>
                <p>
                    The stock prices are shown in Euros (â‚¬). Preferably from the <a href="https://www.tradegate.de">Tradegate exchange</a>. 
                    Other exchanges from Germany may be used if Tradegate is not available.
                    <br/>
                    You can still use stockflow.net if your country uses a different currency.
                    The machine learning process is currency agnostic. 
                    It learns the intrinsic patterns of the historic stock prices and the trained neural network will perform just as well on charts of a different currency.
                    <br/>
                    However, if you like to export your buy/sell decisions and forward them to a broker to actually buy and sell stocks, 
                    it is recommended to at least check that your broker shows the same price as exported from stockflow.
                    <br/>
                    If you absolutely need StockFlow to show other currencies or exchanges, you'll have to host it on your own machine with your own data provider. 
                    The source code is available on <a href="http//www.github.com/chrwoizi/stockflow">github</a>.
                    See <a href="https://github.com/chrwoizi/stockflow/tree/master/StockFlow.Node.Providers">StockFlow.Node.Providers</a> for a reference implementation. Nodejs programming skills are required.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <a id="train"><h2>How does the machine learning work?</h2></a>
                <p>
                    Machine learning depends on input and reference data.
                    In the case of StockFlow, the input data is the stock price history of the past five years.
                    The reference data is your decision (buy, wait, sell) for that stock at that point of time. 
                    This is also called the 'expected' output.
                    <br/>
                    The price history is given to a neural network which computes its own decision.
                    If, by chance, the network's decision and your decision are equal, the network is fine.
                    It probably won't be, because an untrained network acts randomly. That's where an optimization algorithm kicks in.
                    It runs backwards through the neural network and makes slight corrections towards the expected output.
                    Over time (meaning several days and tens of thousands of users decisions), the network is driven to match your decisions.
                    <br/>
                    Neural networks are good at pattern recognition. 
                    That's why it (usually) also performs well on new and unseen data.
                    Meaning that a well-trained neural network can mimic the user with nearly 100% accuracy.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2>How many decisions do I need for training?</h2>
                <p>
                    The training process needs approximately 10000 user decisions to mimic the user with 90% accuracy on new and unseen stock price charts.
                    Optimal accuracy is expected at 30000+ decisions. 
                    <br/>
                    These may take a while to produce, even if you are using StockFlow daily.
                    That's why, in the meantime, it is recommended to actually send your <a href="http://stockflow.net/manage">recorded trades</a> to a broker and trade these stocks for real (at your own investment risk).
                    See <a href="#trade"><i>Does StockFlow actually buy and sell stocks?</i></a> on how to do that automatically. Advanced computer skills are required.
                </p>

                <h2>How can I train the neural network?</h2>
                <p>
                    Your data is processed daily and available for download on <a href="http://stockflow.net/manage">your account page</a>.
                    The source code of the neural network is publicly available on github at <a href="https://github.com/chrwoizi/stockflow/tree/master/StockFlow.AI">StockFlow.AI</a>. 
                    There you'll also find a readme page which explains how to install and run the training.
                    Advanced computer skills are required.
                    <br/>
                    In the future, this website may integrate the neural network training.
                    Training a network requires lots of computing power which costs some money.
                    Therefore, the training service problably won't be free of charge.
