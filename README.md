# StockFlow
StockFlow is a machine learning application that mimics stock trading decisions of the user. 

The trading philosophy is chart-based only, i.e. the only resource data for a decision is the price history of the past 5 years. No stock name, no news, no ratings. Only the chart.

A website shows current stock charts to the user and lets him/her choose whether to buy, ignore, or sell the stock. The chart data and the decision are stored in a database. 

In future versions, a Tensorflow neural network is going to be trained on the recorded decisions. This neural network is going to be used to decide automatically whether to buy or sell a stock based on its current chart.
